            <p>We are two young professionals with a passion for each other, our jobs, and life. Both of us want to share with you the fun parts about dating and our relationship that you can learn from and be entertained by.
	We live in the Pacific North West and both want to try new things and be spontaneous but often times that takes planning and we want to make that just a little bit easier for everyone else out there.
	Our posts will be described from both perspectives (His, Hers) so that you get potentially a different take on the same event, product, or date idea.
